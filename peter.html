        <br>
        <h2 class="font"></h2>I had the incredible opportunity to work on and help renovate a golf course in Raymond, WA. Embarking on this journey was a thrilling experience, allowing me to combine my passion for golf with my expertise in course design and renovation. From the outset, I was immersed in every aspect of the project, from planning and conceptualization to hands-on work in reshaping bunkers, redesigning greens, and refining fairways. Drawing upon my skills in landscaping and turf management, I sought to enhance the natural beauty of the course while optimizing its layout for strategic play. With each decision made, I was driven by a commitment to uphold the integrity of the course and ensure that it would provide an unforgettable experience for golfers of all levels. It was an honor to contribute to the transformation of this beloved golfing destination, and I am proud to have played a role in shaping its future for years to come.</h2>
